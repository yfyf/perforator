Q for Gytis:
    * why is the plugin copying all the .beam's into it's own dir, is that
    necessary? Would make more sense to just use the normal ones living in
    ebin/?

* receive should be broadcasted to all collectors *instantly*, because if one
of them is dead then others are still collecting false data!
